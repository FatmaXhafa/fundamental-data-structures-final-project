AUBG Olympics 
AUBG Olympics is much like the real Olympic Games, only with slightly less participants and a considerably greater deal of fun. It is a whole-day sports event, which gives AUBG-ers the opportunity to compete in some of their favorite sport disciplines like basketball, football, track and field and even tug of war. Our Olympics is held every spring and is solely organized by students at the American University of Bulgaria.
